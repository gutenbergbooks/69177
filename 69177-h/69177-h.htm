<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>If any one of those mysterious autocrats who “do” the reviews
“on” some newspaper or serial shall, in his condescension, deign
to inform public opinion what he may think about <span class="smcap">Mirth and
Metre</span>, that autocrat, unless he be in an unhoped-for state
of benignity, will, doubtless, commence with the agreeable remark
that “the work before us consists of certain Lays and Legends,
written in paltry imitation of the productions of the <i>in</i>imitable
Thomas Ingoldsby.”</p>

<p>Admitting the imputation without cavil, (except at the word
“paltry,” which <i>really</i> is too bad, don’t you think so, dear reader?)
the authors would inquire whether such an admission legitimately
exposes them to hostile criticism? When the late Mr. Barham
produced the “Ingoldsby Legends,” he, as it were, founded a new
school of comic versification. That this is not a mere <i>ipse dixit</i>
of our own is evinced by the fact that, in common parlance, a
man who adopts this style of composition is said to have written
an “Ingoldsby,” as he might be said to have written an Epic, had
he chosen that form instead.</p>

<p>To assert that only a very small shred of Mr. Barham’s mantle
has fallen upon any of his imitators (a fact to which none will more
readily assent than the present writers), is simply to state that
the standard we have proposed to ourselves is a high one, and
proportionately difficult to attain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is a fact which does not appear to have checked the energies or
paralysed the ambition of the “king of men;” nor was Waterloo
the less a great victory because Julius Cæsar had a few centuries
before successfully invaded Gaul.</p>

<p>To our thinking, however, the common sense of the matter
lies (after the usual fashion of that inestimable quality) in a nutshell.
A servile copy of any particular style—a hash of old ideas,
or want of ideas, served up after the manner of some popular
writer—is a bad thing, against which all true lovers of literature
are bound to raise their voices whenever they meet with it; but
if a young author, imbued with admiration of, and respect for,
some man of genius who has lived before him, sees fit to embody
his own thoughts and feelings in a form which experience has
approved, rather than confuse himself and his readers, in his
frantic strivings after originality, by torturing words out of their
natural meaning, and marshalling them in a metre against which
the ear rebels, we conceive no just canon of criticism can forbid
his doing so. To which of these categories the Lays and
Legends in this Volume are to be assigned, we leave it to our
readers to determine.</p>

    <div class="verse indent12">On every side</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">The county did many a suitor ride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Who, wishing to marry, determined to call</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And propose for the heiress of Allinghame Hall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Knights who’d gathered great fame in</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Stabbing, cutting, and maiming</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">The French and their families</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">At Blenheim and Ramilies,</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">And fain would have taught her</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To fancy they loved her, not one of them caught her.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maude received them all civilly, asked them to dine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave them capital venison, and excellent wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But declared, when they popp’d, that she’d really no notion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’d had serious intentions—she owned their devotion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was excessively flattering—quite touching—in fact</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She was grieved at the part duty forced her to act;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still her recent bereavement—her excellent father—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Here she took out her handkerchief) yes, she had rather—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rather not (here she sobbed) say a thing so unpleasant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But she’d made up her mind not to marry at present.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might she venture to hope that she still should retain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their friendship?—to lose that would cause her <i>such</i> pain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would they like to take supper?—she feared etiquette,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">A thing not to be set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At defiance by one in her sad situation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Having no “Maiden Aunt,” or old moral relation</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Of orthodox station,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Whose high reputation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">And prim notoriety,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Should inspire society</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a very deep sense of the strictest propriety;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such a relative wanting, she feared, so she said,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But the night was so fine—just the thing for a ride—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must they go? Well, good-bye,—and here once more she sighed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then a last parting smile on the suitor she threw,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The good King Tidrich rode from Bern<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(And a funny name had he),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His charger was bay, and he took his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Under the greenwood-tree;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ever he sang, as he rode along,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">“’Tis a very fine thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To be a crowned king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to feel one’s right arm strong.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">King Tidrich was clad in armour of proof</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(Whatever that may be)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his helmet shone with many a stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Inserted cunningly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While on his shield one might behold</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">A lion trying</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Emblazoned in burnished gold.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">King Tidrich was counting his money o’er,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As he rode the greenwood through,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he was aware of a “shocking affair,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a terrible “to-do;”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then loudly he shouted with pure delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">“A glorious row,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll on, and view the fight.”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And a fearful sight it was, I ween,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For a dragon old, and a lion bold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Were striving wrathfully;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the monarch perceived from the very first—</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And it made him sad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">For “a reason he had,”—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the lion would get the worst.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When the lion saw the royal Knight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These were the words he said:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“O mighty King, assistance bring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or I am fairly sped;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the battle has been both fierce and long;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Two days and a night</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Have I urged the fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the dragon’s unpleasantly strong.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In a kind of Low Dutch did the lion speak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor his stops did he neglect,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But e’en in his hurry, for Lindley Murray</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Preserved a marked respect;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he managed his H’s according to rule:</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Full well I ween</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Taught at some Public School.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Long paused the royal hero then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Grave thoughts passed through his brain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his queen thought he, and his fair countrie<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He never might see again;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But he thought of the lion he bore on his shield,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And a dragon I detest;</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The first stroke that the monarch made,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Poured forth the crimson flood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when the hero struck again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The treacherous sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Forsook its lord,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The dragon laid him on her back</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With a triumphant air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And flung the horse her jaws across,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As a greyhound would seize a hare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At a fearful pace to her rocky den,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To serve as food</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Against the cavern’s rocky side</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Up rose a youthful dragon then,</div>

<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> King Tidrich, Dietrich, or Theoderic, the son of Thietmar, king of Bern,
and the fair Odilia, daughter of Essung Jarl, was, as it were, the central
hero of that well-known, popular, and interesting work the “Book of
Heroes,” which relates the deeds of the champions who attached themselves
to him, and the manner in which they joined his fellowship.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Tidrich of Bern was also king of Aumlungaland (Italy); he espoused
Herraud, daughter of King Drusiad, a relation of Attila.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> These three champions were among the eleven heroes who accompanied
Tidrich in his memorable expedition to contend against the twelve guardians
of the Garden of Roses at Worms.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> They had a weakness for naming swords in those days, just as in the
nineteenth century we delight in bestowing euphonious titles on “villa
residences,” puppy dogs, and men-of-war!</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Sigurd, or Siegfried, son of Sigmond, king of Netherland, is the chief
hero of the Nibelungen Lay. There are various accounts of his death, one
of the least improbable supposes him to have been destroyed by a dragon.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As I heard it you shall hear it,—by one whom I revere, it</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir Walter Ralph de Guyon, of a noble house the scion,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But when the fight was over, escaping under cover</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Save when his daughter Alice would say in playful malice,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And that as a maid she’d tarry, till she found a chance to marry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With one true to William, her bold king, and Mary, her good queen.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Sir Walter’s brow would darken, and he’d mutter, “Alice, hearken!</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ay! De Ruyter was a gentleman, and high-bred were his people;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And then on this occasion a grand reconciliation</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Could we only give credit to half we are told,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Which from merely a footstep presumes the whole man)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By our <i>Savans</i> disturbing those very large bones,</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">And have chosen to wait a</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Long while hid in <i>strata</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While old Time has been dining on empires and thrones.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Old bones and dry bones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Leg-bones and thigh-bones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bones of the vertebræ, bones of the tail,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Very like, only more so, the bones of a whale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bones that were very long, bones that were very short</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">As I think I can prove, without further apology,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What I said to be true, sans appeal to geology,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That there lived in the good old days gone by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Things unknown to our modern philosophy,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sir Eppo of Epstein was young, brave, and fair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dark were the curls of his clustering hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dark the moustache that o’ershadowed his lip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his glance was as keen as the sword at his hip;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though the enemy’s charge was like lightning’s fierce shock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His seat was as firm as the wave-beaten rock;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And woe to the foeman, whom pride or mischance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opposed to the stroke of his conquering lance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He carved at the board, and he danced in the hall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the ladies admired him, each one and all.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a word, I should say, he appears to have been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As nice a young “ritter” as ever was seen.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">He could not read nor write,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">He could not spell his name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Towards being a clerk, Sir Eppo, his (†) mark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Was as near as he ever came.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">He had felt no vexation</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">From multiplication;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Never puzzled was he</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">By the rule of three;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">The practice he’d had</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Did not drive him mad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Because it all lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Quite a different way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The Asses’ Bridge, that Bridge of Sighs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Had (lucky dog!) ne’er met his eyes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a very few words he expressed his intention</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once for all to decline every Latin declension,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When persuaded to add, by the good Father Herman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That most classical tongue to his own native German.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And no doubt he was right in</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Point of fact, for a knight in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those days was supposed to like nothing but fighting;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one who had learned any language that is hard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would have stood a good chance of being burned for a wizard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Education being then never pushed to the verge ye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now see it, was chiefly confined to the clergy.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas a southerly wind and a cloudy sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For aught that I know to the contrary;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If it wasn’t, it ought to have been proper<i>ly</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it’s certain Sir Eppo, his feather bed scorning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thought that <i>something</i> proclaimed it a fine hunting morning;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">So, pronouncing his benison</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">O’er a cold haunch of venison,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He floored the best half, drank a gallon of beer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And set out on the Taurus to chase the wild deer.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir Eppo he rode through the good greenwood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his bolts flew fast and free;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He knocked over a hare, and he passed the lair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(The tenant was out) of a grisly bear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He started a wolf, and he got a snap shot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At a bounding roe, but he touched it not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which caused him to mutter a naughty word</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In German, which luckily nobody heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he said it right viciously;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he struck his steed with his armèd heel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As though horse-flesh were tougher than iron or steel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or anything else that’s unable to feel.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What is the sound that meets his ear?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it the plaint of some wounded deer?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it the wild-fowl’s mournful cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the scream of yon eagle soaring high?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or is it only the southern breeze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it sighs through the boughs of the dark pine trees?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No Sir Eppo, be sure ’tis not any of these:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
    <div class="verse indent10">And hark, again!</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">It comes more plain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis a woman’s voice in grief or pain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Like an arrow from the string,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Like a stone that leaves the sling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a railroad-train with a queen inside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With directors to poke and directors to guide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the rush upon deck when a vessel is sinking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like (I vow I’m hard up for a simile) winking!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In less time than by name you Jack Robinson can call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir Eppo dashed forward o’er hedge, ditch, and hollow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a steeple-chase style I’d be sorry to follow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And found a young lady chained up by the ankle—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, chained up in a cool and business-like way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if she’d been only the little dog Tray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, the more to secure any knight-errant’s pity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She was really and truly excessively pretty.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here was a terrible state of things!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down from his saddle Sir Eppo springs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As lightly as if he were furnished with wings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While every plate in his armour rings.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The words that he uttered were short and few,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But pretty much to the purpose too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As sternly he asked, with lowering brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who’s been and done it, and where is he now?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">’Twere long to tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Each word that fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the coral lips of that demoiselle;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">However, as far as I’m able to see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pith of the matter appeared to be</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That a horrible giant, twelve feet high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Having gazed on her charms with a covetous eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had stormed their castle, murdered papa,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behaved very rudely to poor dear mamma,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Walked off with the family jewels and plate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the tin and herself at a terrible rate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Then by way of conclusion</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">To all this confusion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Tied her up like a dog</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">To a nasty great log,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To induce her (the brute) to become Mrs. Gog;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That ’twas not the least use for Sir Eppo to try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To chop off his head, or to poke out his eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he’d early in life done a bit of Achilles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Which, far better than taking an “Old Parr’s life-pill” is,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had been dipped in the Styx, or some equally old stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And might now face unharmed a battalion of Coldstream.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">But she’d thought of a scheme</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Which did certainly seem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Very likely to pay—no mere vision or dream:—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It appears that the giant each day took a nap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For an hour (the wretch!) with his head in her lap:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, she hated it so! but then what could she do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here she paused, and Sir Eppo remarked, “Very true;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that during this time one might pinch, punch, or shake him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or do just what one pleased, but that nothing could wake him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While each horse and each man in the emperor’s pay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would not be sufficient to move him away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without magical aid, from the spot where he lay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In an old oak chest, in an up-stairs room</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of poor papa’s castle, was kept an heir-loom,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">An enchanted net, made of iron links,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which was brought from Palestine, she thinks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By her great grandpapa, who had been a Crusader;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If she had but got that, she was sure it would aid her.</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Sir Eppo, kind man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Approves of the plan;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Says he’ll do all she wishes as quick as he can;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Begs she wont fret if the time should seem long;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Snatches a kiss, which was “pleasant but wrong;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mounts, and taking a fence in good fox-hunting style,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sets off for her family-seat on the Weil.</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">The sun went down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">The bright stars burned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">The morning came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">And the knight returned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">The net he spread</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">O’er the giant’s bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While Eglantine, and Hare-bell blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And some nice green moss on the spot he threw;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest perchance the monster alarm should take,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And not choose to sleep from being too <i>wide awake</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Hark to that sound!</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">The rocks around</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Tremble—it shakes the very ground;</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">While Irmengard cries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">As tears stream from her eyes,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lady-like weakness we must not despise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(And here, let me add, I have been much to blame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I long ago ought to have mentioned her name):</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here he comes! now do hide yourself, dear Eppo, pray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For <i>my</i> sake, I entreat you, keep out of his way.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Scarce had the knight</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Time to get out of sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among some thick bushes, which covered him quite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere the giant appeared. Oh! he was such a fright!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was very square built, a good twelve feet in height,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his waistcoat (three yards round the waist) seemed too tight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, to add even yet to all this singularity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had but one eye, and his whiskers were carroty.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What an anxious moment! Will he lie down?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, how their hearts beat! he seems to frown,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No, ’tis only an impudent fly that’s been teasing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His <i>snub</i>lime proboscis, and set him a sneezing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Attish hu! attish hu!</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">You brute, how I wish you</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Were but as genteel as the Irish lady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Dear Mrs. O’Grady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, chancing to sneeze in a noble duke’s face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hoped she hadn’t been guilty of splashing his Grace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, look out. Yes, he will! No, he wont! By the powers!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thought he was taking alarm at the flowers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But it luckily seems, his gigantic invention</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has at once set them down as a little attention</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Irmengard’s part,—done by way of suggestion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That she means to say “Yes,” when he next pops the question.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There! he’s down! now he yawns, and in one minute more—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thought so, he’s safe—he’s beginning to snore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He is wrapped in that sleep he shall wake from no more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From his girdle the knight take a ponderous key;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It fits—and once more is fair Irmengard free.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From heel to head, and from head to heel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They wrap their prey in that net of steel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they <i>croché</i> the edges together with care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As you finish a purse for a fancy-fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the last knot is tied by the diligent pair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At length they have ended their business laborious,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Eppo shouts “Bagged him, by all that is glorious!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
    <div class="verse indent10">No billing and cooing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">You must up and be doing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Depend on’t, Sir Knight, this is no time for wooing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll discover, unless you progress rather smarter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That catching a giant’s like catching a Tartar:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He still has some thirty-five minutes to sleep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close to this spot hangs a precipice steep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like Shakspeare’s tall cliff which they show one at Dover;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drag him down to the brink, and then let him roll over;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As they scarce make a capital crime of infanticide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There can’t be any harm in a little giganticide.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pull him, and haul him! take care of his head!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, how my arms ache—he’s as heavy as lead!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That’ll do, love—I’m sure I can move him alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though I’m certain the brute weighs a good forty stone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yo! heave ho! roll him along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(It’s exceedingly lucky the net’s pretty strong);</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once more—that’s it—there, now, I think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s done to a turn, he rests on the brink;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At it again, and over he goes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To furnish a feast for the hooded crows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each vulture that makes the Taurus his home</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May dine upon giant for months to come.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Lives there a man so thick of head</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To whom it must in words be said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">How Eppo did the lady wed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And built upon the giant’s bed</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">A castle, walled and turreted?</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">We will hope not; or, if there be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Defend us from his company!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">From time immemorial, since Helen lost Troy,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Had they christened him Jack, she’d have “loved him the same,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because—mark the reason—her Pa had been rude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To his Guv’nor, which led to a family feud.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So the Lord Lettelhausen called up his son Loridon,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">As by magic appeared, laid their lances in rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And directed their points to the herald’s bare breast,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sight which it must be confessed might alarm a</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brave man in those very unscrupulous days,</div>

    <div class="verse indent12">Howe’er this may be,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">When your wife’s taken cross, or the “olive-branch” sick;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When your wardrobe’s worn out, and your tailor wont “tick;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When your money’s all gone, and your creditors dun for it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">I think you’ll agree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">That the best plan will be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To (I speak in the language of slang) “cut and run for it.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus, then, reason’d Yolenta of Corteryke, but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With this difference, she “ran” to avoid the “cut”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all cuts “most unkindest” (bad grammar, you know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When it’s written by Shakespeare no longer is so),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which De Rodon had promised her, <i>axe</i>-ing her hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a manner no woman of feeling could stand</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With composure; so straightway Yolenta resolved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make herself scarce, which manœuvre involved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Much domestic confusion; each man and each maid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Requiring their wages, and board-wages, paid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For a month in advance; while the butler grew crusty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As his oldest port wine; and fair Bettye cried “Must I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be the cause of this woe—from my dear mistress sever—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lose my place and my perquisites! which my endeavour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has still been to draw mild. Well, I never did—never!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Then addressing the public at large) “Did <i>you</i> ever?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These arrangements concluded, Yolenta began</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Packing up—the last duty of travelling man—</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">But the business of life</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">To maid, widow, or wife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Except Ida Pfeiffer, that wonder, who can</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With umbrella and tooth-brush, reach far Yucatan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">And, like Ariel, span</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The earth with a girdle, which some commentator</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Shakespeare imagines must mean the Equator.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well, she packed up her traps in a leathern valise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which contained sundry stockings, a nice new ⸺, but he’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No gentleman, clearly, who’d Hobbs-like, the locks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Endeavour to pick of <i>so</i> private a box.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, by way of disguise, Dame Yolenta decided</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Don’t be horrified, dear lady-readers, though I did</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Myself think it strange that my heroine chose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To set out on her rambles attired in <i>such</i> clothes),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For convenience of trav’lling, perhaps, to assume a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man’s dress—not the epicene compromise, Bloomer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the regular masculine <i>propria quæ maribus</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A male coat, a male waistcoat, <i>et ceteris paribus</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">A gay cap and feather,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Unfit for bad weather,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sword by her side, and a fine prancing horse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which she sat, I’m afraid, not “aside” but “across;”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
    <div class="verse indent10">With one groom to attend her—</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Nought else to defend her—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a “Young Lochinvar” of the feminine gender,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ill-fated Yolenta rode off at a canter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And became what the stockbrokers term “a levanter.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Now you’ll please to suppose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">That she follow’d her nose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fine aquiline organ that proudly arose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Filling just the right space</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">On her bright sparkling face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Excelling, as butterfly’s better than grub,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those unlucky <i>“retroussés</i>” in <i>plain</i> English, “snub,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which men always pretend to, and often desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But never can really and truly admire;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The whys and the wherefores, the <i>cons</i> and the <i>pros</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which decide other folks; in the fair sex our trust is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Extreme; so we’ll strive not to do her injustice.)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For some reason unknown, then, she followed her nose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the camp of King Charles, in which Loridon chose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wear out his exile, and solace his woes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By assisting that monarch to conquer his foes.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">It were long to relate</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">All the evils that Fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seemed resolved to pour down on our heroine’s pate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">How, on reaching the camp,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Although, when she handed his fees to him, he said</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
    <div class="verse indent10">It was all right and proper,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">And no one would stop her;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which was false, for it quickly appeared by the law</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the strong, she was somebody’s prisoner of war;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Next, for fear in her wrath she a breach of the peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should commit, or attempt to assault the police,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They disarmed her—laid hands on her watch, chain, and seal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(All the very best gold, and the watch not much thicker</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than a mod’rate sized turnip—no end of a ticker,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And hurried her off to the then Pentonville</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Model Prison, to wait, all forlorn and alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to “carve her name on the Newgate stone,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till this terrible somebody’s pleasure was known.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">In a dungeon, deep, damp, and unpleasant; behind her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was a ring in the wall, and some rusty old chains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there lay in one corner a skull void of brains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a horrid leg-bone stood upright in another,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which must once have belonged to “a man and a brother;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then a sturdy support, now a most “unreal mockery,”</div>

    <div class="verse indent10">Dry bread and cold water,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wretched food, and by no means enlivening drink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Whatever hydraulic George Cruikshank may think</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">By this treatment, enough, the brutes next dissipated her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Last agreeable illusion, a letter was given her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Signed and sealed by some friendly (?) anonymous scrivener,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Short, not sweet, for the missive consisted of one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Line, “<i>The Lord Lettelhausen’s no longer a son</i>,”—</div>

  </div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fix’d her eyes on it, shed o’er it tears of despair,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Just as much as an Anglican crowd in the present day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Think attending the “Manning” <i>finale</i> a pleasant day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">So extremely they bustled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Pushed, jostled, and hustled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Climbed up lamp-posts, (there were none!) on each rising ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stood to view the procession, as slowly it wound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its way to the cathedral, where, at the high altar</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">The condemned was “<i>pro se</i>”</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">To appear, or else be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Declared recusant, most contumacious, defaulter,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And yet seems to last pretty well through all ages,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keeps solicitors going, and provides their clerks wages.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas a splendid and beautiful pageant, that same;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First a body of archers and shield-bearers came;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then some dear little choristers, dressed all in white,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who each carried a <i>chandelle bénie</i>, or “child’s light,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, being blessed by the Pope, it appears to my thick head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must, in spite of its wick, have no longer been <i>wick</i>ed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Next came Abbot Geraldus, profusely ornate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With mitre, and crosier, and garments of state;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the Herald de Rodon, in great exultation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Highly pleased with himself, and the whole “situation;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Then a servitor, bearing</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">A big candle, flaring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up like mad, and creating a vast cloud of vapour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or smoke, (which affair was a “penitent taper,”)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On a silver “<i>Lavabo</i>,” a word which they say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In middle-age Latin, means simply a tray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And after this penitent candle there came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our penitent heroine, looking the same,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">How the poor thing would feel in so cruel a mess.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then came something of which the description we’d best give</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is, like Tennyson’s rhymes, it was “sweetly suggestive”—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A large shield, in the centre whereof was depicted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hand lately severed,—the artist, addicted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(’Twas De Rodon himself) to pre-Raphaelite rules,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had made the wrist “<i>sanglant</i>” with drops from it “<i>gules</i>.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then directly behind this agreeable affair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came the city “Jack Ketch” with his horrid axe bare!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">As ever resented the slightest slight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Or broke an antagonist’s head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full tall was his stature, full stalwart his frame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full red was his hair, his beard was the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mustachios and whiskers—whence his name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">His name of Sir Rupert the Red.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir Rupert he lived in a castle old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Residence meet for a baron bold:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thick were its walls, and dark and cold</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The swift Rhine ran below them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full handy to Rupert the Red was the Rhine:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rich travellers passing were asked to dine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when he’d sufficiently hocussed their wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Why—into its waters he’d throw them!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But stories will spread, howe’er you may try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To stifle Dame Rumour—and so, by-and-bye,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And when asked to dinner, each neighbour fought shy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bell ne’er was rung, and no stranger implored</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The porter to run up, and question his lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he kindly would grant a night’s shelter and board?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No priest on Sir Rupert’s head called down a benison,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No acquaintance sent presents of black-cock and venison.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While his former bad temper began to grow worse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He would mutter and fidget—nay, stamp, foam, and curse;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But his feelings I’ll try to describe in the verse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most used by our Alfred—not Bunn though, but Tennyson.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Very early in the morning would he, tumbling out of bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mow his chin with wretched razor, mow and hack it till it bled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then he’d curse the harmless cutler, heap upon him curses deep—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Curse him in his hour of waking, doubly curse him in his sleep—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saying, “Mechi! O my Mechi! O my Mechi, mine no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whither’s fled that brilliant sharpness which thy razors had of yore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere thou quittedst Leadenhall-street, quittedst it with many a qualm—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere thou soughtest rustic Tiptree, Tiptree and its model farm?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a morning, by the mirror, did I pass thee o’er my beard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my chin grew smooth beneath thee, of its hairy harvest cleared;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many an evening have I drawn thee ’cross the throats of wretched Jews,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When they, trembling, showed their purses, stuffed for safety in their shoes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, like mine, thy day is over—thou art blunt and I’m disgraced!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Curses on thy maker’s projects, curses on his ‘magic paste.’”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus he grumbled all day, from morning till night—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No person could please him, no conduct was right—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till his very retainers grew furious quite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And determined to quit his service.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For much afflicted was Seneschal Hans;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the groom from York told the cook from France</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“He warn’t going to be led such a precious dance</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">Oh, “the castled crag of Drachenfels,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">With its slippery sides and flowery dells,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er to cease to remember the Gunpowder-plot.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The herald stept forth, and he made a low bow—</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">The banquet is spread—</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">At his table’s head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Decked out in gay garments, sits Rupert the Red;</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My story thus forward, I now must relate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some previous details concerning the fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of that famous young hero, Sir Blutwurst the Great,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">Of whom I’ve just made mention—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so, to prevent the smallest mystery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or the thread of my story from getting a twist awry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To his death, which took place ere the date of my history,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">I must call my readers’ attention.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Blutwurst and Rupert were two pretty men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As ever were sketched by pencil or pen—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Together they’d hunt, shoot, fish, frolic, and gamble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In short, to dispense with a longer preamble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">They so loved each other,</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">That Corsican Brother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or Damon, or Pythias, or Siamese twin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er cared for his friend, or his kith or his kin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As did Blutwurst for Rupert: they ne’er knew division,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But were like Box and Cox in a German edition.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mr. Coleridge says, “Truth, that exists in the young,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too often is killed by a whispering tongue;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this proved the case between Blutwurst and Rupert.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The former, perhaps, in his language was too pert;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For having committed some irregularities,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which <i>he</i> called “peccadilloes,” but others “barbarities,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir Rupert declined to subscribe to some charities</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which Blutwurst advised as a species of “hedge.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the latter blazed out;—the “thin end of the wedge”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Being thus once inserted, the matter grew serious.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Each spake words of high disdain</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">And insult to his heart’s best brother—</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">“Just repeat those words again!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">“You’re a scoundrel!” “You’re another!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With curses and oaths, to repeat which would weary us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till from furious words they proceeded to blows.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who first drew his rapier nobody knows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Hans, the old seneschal, sitting down stairs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heard a shriek, then a plunge in the river, he swears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And going up found Rupert, all haggard and wan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who stated that Blutwurst had started for Bonn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And requested that thither his bag be sent on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">This story gained ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Till the body was found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A great distance off—in fact, down at Dusseldorf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence the horrified finder all hurriedly bustled off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To tell Blutwurst’s parents the terrible news.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A coroner’s inquest was held on the body,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where, after much talking and more Hollands toddy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Much anger, much squabbling, and dreadful abuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They found that, “returning home, muddled with wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The deceased had been murdered and flung in the Rhine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By some persons unknown, with malicious design!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Rupert no blame e’er attached in the matter;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor Blutwurst was called mad, “as mad as a hatter,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For drinking so much as to fall from his perch.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now, if you please, we’ll return to the castle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where I think we shall find that, fatigued by the wassail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With two small exceptions, each master and vassal</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">May safely be reckoned as “fast as a church.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>

    <div class="verse indent8">Seem before her to rise,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And she sees in the mirror, not herself, but <i>him</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Yes! he kneels at her side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Says he wont be denied;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And calls her “his dear little duck of a bride!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His utt’rance is thick, his cravat is untied,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">His gait is unsteady, his manner so rude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It’s plain to perceive that Sir Rupert is “screwed.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he touches his heart, and he turns up his eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by language and gesture most earnestly tries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To convince her that ne’er from his knees will he rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till to wed on the morrow she freely complies.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">When Henri Quatre ruled in France there was a gay young knight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The loudest in the banquet-hall, the foremost in the fight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No dame, howe’er fatigued, to tread a measure could refuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When she heard the silver accents of Count Louis of Toulouse.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But not only to a dance would these gentle tones invite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to “measures” of more dangerous kind, confounding wrong with right.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Won over by his sophistry, what conscience could accuse?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the dread of every husband was Count Louis of Toulouse.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The man above all others who the direst hate did feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was the husband of fair Eleanor, the Marquis de St. Lille;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he vowed the deepest vengeance when he heard the dreadful news</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That his wife had found a lover in Count Louis of Toulouse.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He called his spies around him, caused her movements to be tracked,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, listening, heard sufficient to convince him of the fact.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then he quietly retired, and determined to infuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some poison in the claret of Count Louis of Toulouse.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Next evening, as the Marchioness was waiting in her bower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The clocks of all the churches round pealed forth the usual hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She began to grow impatient, murmur, and at length abuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The extreme unpunctuality of Louis of Toulouse.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But when two servants entered, who between them bore a box,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She was half afraid that something else had struck besides the clocks;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when the men retired, she still thinking it a <i>ruse</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Raised up the lid and found the corpse of Louis of Toulouse.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Without a word, without a shriek, she fell upon the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The maidens hast’ning to her aid, a lifeless body found.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, young gentlemen, take warning, and ne’er yourselves amuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By attempting fascinations like Count Louis of Toulouse.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mr. and Mrs. Theophilus Browne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had a house in a newly-built suburb of town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Twelve good rooms and an attic.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mr. Browne had a share in a City bank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when at home “the shop” he sank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And assuming the airs of a person of rank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was quite aristocratic.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Invitations to dinner he oft obtained,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Showers of cards upon him rained,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For party and picnic pleasant;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indeed, ’twas his constant pride and boast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That his name once appeared in the “Morning Post,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Which he took each day with his tea and toast,)</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As “amongst the company present.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But as never was rose without a thorn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So surely was mortal never born</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To a life without vexation;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And some bachelor chums of our friend Mr. B.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had a habit of “dropping in to tea,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And merely saying, “We’ve made so free,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would create quite a consternation.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For they reeked of tobacco, that dreadful herb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which will ever a lady’s nerves disturb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">E’en the mildest of mild Havannah;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when with their cabman they came to arrange,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They never appeared to have any change</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To settle his fare, but in language strange</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They borrowed “two bob and a tanner.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We need not say that poor Mrs. Browne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had a hate of these rollicking men about town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of which she made no mystery;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But surely her bitterness and spite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were never wrought up to such a height</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As upon the very eventful night</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When we commence our history.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The servants had all retired to rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The worthy couple, in <i>deshabille</i> dressed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Had just finished their nightly refection,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When a thundering double knock at the door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Caused Mrs. Browne to exclaim, “Oh Lor!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While her husband added to “what a bore”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">An ungodly interjection.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, seizing a light, he ran down stairs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Growling like one of the grisly bears</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the Gardens Zoological</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(That lately were cured with such skill and tact,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of an overflowing cataract,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Which a very artful dodge-I-call).</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He opened the door in a furious rage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor did it his passion at all assuage</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To see his old friend, Jack Rasper,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jack Rasper, the fastest man in town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who never would go when he once sat down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who mimicked all actors of renown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And could row with Coombes or Clasper.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His intimates called him “an out-and-out brick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fellow who at nothing would stick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a first-rate judge of malt, sir.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, the ladies themselves, who are clearly the best</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To decide on such matters, had often confessed.—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mr. Rasper, besides being very well dressed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was an excellent <i>deux-temps</i> waltzer.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Darting past the unhappy Browne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the foot of the stairs he sat himself down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And laughed like the clown in a pantomime;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then jumping up, he made a grimace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might have rivalled e’en Mr. Grimaldi’s face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To describe the which with sufficient grace</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Quite baffles my Muse for want-o’-rhyme.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Browne,” he began, “I’m come to sup.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I suppose I may. Walk up, walk up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And observe the living lions;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thickly-coated armadillo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brought from furrin’ parts beyond the billow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Don Alphonso de Padrillo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That ornament of science!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, joking apart, Browne, how’s your wife?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not annoyed, I hope; to cause any strife</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Would give me infinite sorrow.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then springing up stairs with a loud “Ha! ha!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He thrust his head through the door ajar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And greeted the lady with “Here we are,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And “How d’ye do to-morrow.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mrs. Browne received him with looks so black</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he felt himself quite taken aback,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And received what he called “a staggerer.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Indeed, as he told his friends next night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“He soon saw that fowl would never fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So he instantly came the dodge polite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And entirely dropped the swaggerer!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then changing his tone, “Mrs. Browne, to you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am sure,” said he, “I ought to sue</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In terms most apologetic.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But not a whit the angry dame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was soothed, her expression remained the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Jack thought he’d best go, the way he came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like a well-bred dog, prophetic.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He tried again, “If you remember,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We went together, last September,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To see the Hippopotamus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how, in the crowd, when you dropped those loves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of delicate tinted primrose gloves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I hunted about with kicks and shoves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Do you recollect who brought ’em us?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lord Augustus Aype, that <i>cheválièr preûx</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who was evidently struck with you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For he said, in a whisper audible,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Rasper, who is that splendid creature?’”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mrs. Browne relaxed in every feature,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For she thought—alas! poor human nature!—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Each act of a Lord was <i>laud-able</i>.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jack continued, “’Twas only yesterday,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At dinner, I heard his lordship say</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He should ne’er forget the circumstance;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has met you since, at a public ball,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or at Albert Smith’s—the Egyptian Hall!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You shake your head! what! not at all?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yes, yes! ’twas at the Kirkham’s dance!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here Browne come frowningly in, but smiled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he found his wife seemed nothing riled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And begged his guest to be seated:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And looking at Mrs. Browne askance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received in return a conjugal glance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which showed, “<i>sans doûte</i>,” as they say in France,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She wished Jack civilly treated.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So he bustled about, and soon laid out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A cold chicken, some ham, a bottle of stout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With ale of Bass’s brewing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when these were dispatched by the modest youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Placed a flask on the board, which, to tell the truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had on it the name of “Sir Felix Booth,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But which Jack pronounced “blue ruin.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jack plied at the spirit, and soon began</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To play so well the agreeable man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The retailer of jokes and scandal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That good Mrs. Browne grew quite elate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Browne, though he muttered, “It’s rather late,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replenished the fire, and swept up the grate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And trimmed the Palmer’s candle.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus went the talk,—“Poor Lady Flashe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has eloped with Captain Sabretasche;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They bolted from Baden-Baden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While Sir Anthony Flashe their flight ne’er checked,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it on his rheumatics had no effect;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the Jews of old, since he’s grown ‘stiffnecked,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His heart has begun to harden.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But I heard last night from Lord De Vere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Boulogne who has just come over here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The most wonderful adventure;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his Lordship last season received a ‘call,’—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not such as those folks who at Exeter Hall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">About Popery wrangle, his was all</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">About railway scrip and debenture.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He said, one night that, homeward walking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There were two men before him, talking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose words caught his instant attention,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he heard one say, as he drew more near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘I’ll cut his throat from ear to ear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And send his soul to ⸺’ a place which here</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I really don’t like to mention.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Shocked at these words, though somewhat alarmed,</div>

PELLUCID RIVERS, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="gothic">Edited by Edmund H. Yates.</span></p>

</div>

<p>In submitting to the public some of the productions of my
lamented friend Rivers, I think it right to endeavour to sketch
some faint outline of the career of their illustrious author. “The
world knows nothing of its greatest men,” says Philip Van
Artevelde, and its general ignorance of Rivers clearly proves the
truth of the remark.</p>

<p>Born of poor but respectable parents, in the parish of St. Pancras,
at an early age Rivers evinced symptoms of that poetic talent
which, in later life, made him so renowned—I mean, which would
have made him so renowned, had he not been crushed by the
wretched blindness and illiberality of the publishers of the metropolis.
He could not have been more than five years of age when
he first burst forth in metrical numbers; it was at the family
dinner-table, when, pointing first to the smoking joint, then to the
domestic implement by which he was conveying a portion of it to
his mouth, he exclaimed—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pork!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Fork!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A moment after, indicating the beer jug, his juvenile “poet’s eye,
in a fine frenzy rolling,” he continued, “chalk!” His meaning on
this point was vague, but it is generally considered he implied that
the liquid was not paid for at the time, but was chalked up behind
the door to the family account—a custom prevalent, I have ascertained,
in many parts of the United Kingdom. From that period
until his death he was constantly engaged in writing;—though his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
name never appeared to any of his productions, they were most
extensively read; indeed, one of his minor poems—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dearest maid, I thee do love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This my tender vows shall prove—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Little Cupid’s thrilling dart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has found refuge in my heart,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">has been considered so successful, that the publication of it is
annually revived, and the fourteenth of February, sacred to St.
Valentine, is the day usually chosen for its reappearance.</p>

<p>For the last twenty years of his life, poor Rivers laboured under
severe fits of melancholy and depression, the cause of which he
long held secret. Shortly before his decease, however, he confided
to me the source of his grief. It was, that manuscripts which he
had forwarded on approval to various publishers, had been returned
as worthless, while a few months afterwards the same publishers
would send forth books of poems in which the most direct
plagiarisms from my poor friend’s productions would appear. He
made me solemnly pledge myself to see him righted in the opinion
of the world, and hence the publication of these papers.</p>

<p>I regret exceedingly to be obliged to hold up to public odium
names which have hitherto stood so highly as those of Mr. A—f—d
T—ys—n and his publisher, Mr. M—x—n, but I defy any candid
reader to peruse the following vigorous and striking stanzas of my
poor friend’s, and then turn to that weak and rambling production,
“L—cks—y H—ll,” without perceiving which is the grand
original, which the mean and despicable parody!</p>

<p>Such is the noble ballad of Vauxhall! but Rivers was master of
all styles. The following exquisite picture of the joys and sorrows
of modern domestic life presents an example of that happy blending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
of the real and the romantic with which the head of Rivers
overflowed. The ballad of “Boreäna” has been kindly communicated
by my literary friend Frank Fairleigh, who knew, loved,
and admired Rivers as much as myself. After pointing out some
of the more subtle and mysterious beauties of this matchless lyric,
Fairleigh adds, “and yet after this, A—f—d T—ny—n had the
face to publish that bombastic, trashy ballad of “Oriana,” and
pretend it was original; where does that misguided man expect to
go to?”</p>

<h3><span class="gothic">Chapter II.</span></h3>

<p>My poor friend had always within him a certain classical fondness
of the ancient style of poetry; none of your vulgar Alcaics
and Sapphics—“These,” he used to remark, “Horace, Tibullus,
or any fellow of that calibre could manage; but the glorious hexameters
and pentameters of Homer, Virgil, and Ovid,—they’re the
things, my boy!” His delight in this species of composition was
so great that at school we used to call him, as a nickname,
“Professor Long-and-short-fellow.” It curdles my blood to think
that some obscure person in America, who has latterly been indulging
in dactyllic and spondaic metre, has dared to name himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
partly in imitation of the <i>sobriquét</i> by which we designated
our friend.</p>

<p>Recollecting poor Pellucid’s warm admiration of the hexameter
then, I have made strict search among his papers, on the chance
of finding some classical Latin or Greek poem of his composition,
but without success. At one time a ray of hope darted through
me, as I came upon a paper carefully folded, and docketted,
“Notions for a Fight between Hector and Achilles;” I unfolded it
eagerly, but, alas! it was only a fragment, the words “Arma
virumque cano” were legibly inscribed in my friend’s neat hand,
but it was evident that he had either been called away, or that the
Muse had deserted him at the critical moment, as he had left it
without another word. At length I chanced to find the following
poem, descriptive of a picnic at Cliefden and its consequences, in
the true classical verse, but, before submitting it to the world, I
must remark that on the outside cover of the MS. is written, in
pencil, and in a hand very similar to that of Mr. B⸺, the publisher,
of F⸺ Street, “Query? Evang’⸺;” the rest of the
word is illegible, and I could never comprehend the meaning of
the comment.</p>

<p><i>Note by the Editor.</i>—In transcribing this poem from my friend’s MS., I
feel it my duty to state that his touching description of his love was not
without foundation. The “knock-down blow” he received did not entirely
floor him; he sought to see the lady again, and, on being repulsed, commenced
a very pretty little poem, beginning—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When he who adores thee has left but the name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his faults and his follies behind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here he stopped, which, I think, was a pity, as he evidently possessed the
feeling and talents essential to an amatory poet.</p>

<h3><span class="gothic">Chapter III.</span></h3>

<p>It is a melancholy pleasure to me to wander among these
vestiges of the departed great man; to trace his various thoughts
from his earliest infancy to the time when death robbed the world
of what should have been its brightest ornament, and left to it
merely the paste and tinsel, the gewgaw and tomfoolery of
literature.</p>

<p>Of his father he has left many records. This person, upon
whom the honour of being Pellucid’s progenitor devolved, appears
to have been a worthy undertaker; an unprofitable one, however,
for he never <i>undertook</i> anything well, nor carried it out successfully.
Nevertheless, his failings or shortcomings in life, served
but to increase the love his son bore him, and which is manifested
in many poetical scraps, evidently written in early life, one of
which, commencing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My father, my dear father, if a name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dearer and holier were, it should be thine,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is worthy of comparison with anything of Byron’s; it is, however,
too long for extract. To his schooldays also, I find many pleasing
allusions scattered through his manuscripts. In a letter to his
sister (which, from family reasons, I am precluded from publishing)
he draws a wonderful sketch of his pedagogue, whom he describes
as being a man severe and stern to view, but who often
relaxed to a joke with his scholars, and was the best hand at
argument in the village, using words of such learned length and
wondrous sound, that the amazed rustics stood gaping at his
knowledge. His “Ode on a Distant Prospect of Islington Free-school,”
is also full of pleasing reminiscences of his younger
days.</p>

<p>Late in life Rivers began to take a great interest in theatrical
matters, and I find among his MSS. the following poem, evidently
written shortly before his decease. One curious fact connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
with these verses is, that as executor of poor Pellucid, I am at
present at loggerheads with one Mr. McAuley, a Scotch gentleman,
who, absurdly enough, claims their authorship:—</p>

<h3><span class="gothic">Chapter IV.</span></h3>

<p>“<i>Poeta nascitur non fit</i>,” is a trite but wise aphorism. Few
men have selected such varied subjects as my friend Rivers, and
few have dealt with their choice so successfully. Unlike your
modern writers, who put on one suit of similes and wear it threadbare
(such as Alessandro Smiffini, for instance, who is never
tired of gazing at the moon or dipping in the sea), Pellucid’s
kindly nature immortalises even the most trivial occurrences of
his life. The following extract from his works will show what I
mean. Unblessed with riches, he had incurred a small bill at a
<i>restaurant</i>, in the neighbourhood of his lodgings, and one night
the proprietor of the hostelry effected an entrance into his
apartment, and refused to quit until the claim was settled. This
circumstance, which would have discomposed a less happy mind,
gave him the idea for a set of verses, which he named “The
Tankard,” and which he calls, “A Domestic Scene turned into
Poetry.” Again, on this manuscript is a pencilled query (in the
same writing to which I have before alluded), “Does he mean
Edgar Poe—try?” I confess this joke is beyond my poor powers
of brain. Perhaps my readers will be able to interpret it, when
they read the verses, which run thus:—</p>

<h4>THE TANKARD.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sitting in my lonely chamber, in this dreary, dark December,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazing on the whitening ashes of my fastly-fading fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pond’ring o’er my misspent chances with that grief which time enhances—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Misdirected application, wanting aims and objects higher,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Aims to which I should aspire.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As I sat thus wond’ring, thinking, fancy unto fancy linking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the half-expiring embers many a scene and form I traced—</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a by-gone scene of gladness, yielding now but care and sadness,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a form once fondly cherished, now by misery’s hand effaced,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Forms which Venus’ self had graced.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Suddenly, my system shocking, at my door there came a knocking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud and furious,—such a rat-tat never had I heard before;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the keyhole I stood peeping, heart into my mouth up-leaping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till at length, my teeth unclenching, faintly said I, “What a bore!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gently, calmly, teeth unclenching, faintly said I, “What a bore!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Said the echo, “Pay your score!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At this solemn warning trembling, some short time I stood dissembling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till again the iron knocker beat its summons ’gainst the door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, the oak wide open throwing, stood I on the threshold bowing—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bows such as, save motley tumbler, mortal never bowed before,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bows which even Mr. Flexmore never yet had tried before:</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Said the echo, “Pay your score!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Grasping then the light, upstanding, looked I round the dreary landing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looked at every wall, the ceiling, looked upon the very floor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nought I saw there but a Tankard, from the which that night I’d drank hard,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drank as drank our good forefathers in the merry days of yore,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the corner stood the Tankard, where it oft had stood before,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Stood and muttered, “Pay your score!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Much I marvelled at this pewter, surely ne’er in past or future</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has been, will be, such a wonder, such a Tankard learned in lore!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gazing at it more intensely, stared I more and more immensely</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When it added, “Come, old boy, you’ve many a promise made before,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">False they were as John O’Connell’s, who would ‘die upon the floor!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Now for once—come, pay your score!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From my placid temper starting, and upon the Tankard darting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With one furious hurl I flung it down before the porter’s door;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But as I my oak was locking, heard I then the self-same knocking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on looking out I saw the Tankard sitting as before,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sitting, squatting in the self-same corner as it sat before,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Sitting, crying “Pay your score!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Tankard, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the very self-same corner where it sat in days of yore:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And its pewter still is shining, and it bears the frothy lining,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which the night when first I drained its cooling beverage it bore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But my mouth that frothy lining never, never tasted more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">Since it muttered, “Pay your score!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have concluded my extracts; the remaining poems are
principally of a private and personal nature, which renders them
unfitted for publication.</p>

<p>After a perusal of his verses there will, I trust, be very few
persons who will not at once appreciate the powers of my
lamented friend, and grieve over the illiberal treatment he experienced.
Should I find that tardy justice is done to his productions,
and that they meet with that posthumous popularity
which is undoubtedly their due, the effort which I have made to
bring him into notice, and to shake the <i>dii majores</i> of the literary
world on their unstable thrones, will not have been unrewarded.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
